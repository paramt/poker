# Poker Solitaire 

Goal: Create a higher 5-card poker hand than the dealer

Gameplay: Select a subset of the deck, then draw a random card. If the card belongs in the subset, it's added to your hand. Otherwise, it's added to the dealer's hand. The game ends when you have 5 cards in your hand. If the dealer has less than 8 cards, they draw to 8 cards.
